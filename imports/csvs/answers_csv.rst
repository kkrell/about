List of columns
---------------

**(1) Identifiers:** The first three columns identify an answer list. An

refere from a question in questionnaire A to an answer list in
questionnaire B.

The fourth column (``value``) identifies an item of an answer list.

answer_list
    Name of the answer\_list within the questionnaire
    (primary key).

value
    Integer value of the answer (primary key).

**(2) Content:** The content of an item is a label. This label can be
translated.


label
    Answer label in the primary language (usualy English).

label_*
    Translations of the label. Please replace ``*`` by a
    two-digit language code, e.g. ``label_de`` for a German label.

Features
--------

Answer labels are translateable. The language of the translation is set
using a two letter code, e.g. ``label_de`` for a German label. The
default language for the column ``label`` is English.
