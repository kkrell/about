question.csv
============

List of columns
---------------

(1) Identifier: The first four columns identify are question. Please
note that a question can consist of multiple items. In this case the
first item is considered to be the root element and the item is either
empty or "root".

study
    Name of the study (primary key).
 
questionnaire
    Name of the questionnaire (primary key).
 
question
    Name of the question (primary key).
 
item
    Number of the question item (primary key). If the ``item`` is empty, the question is considered to be a "root question", which might have items.
 

(2) Content: The following columns represent the content of a
question or item

number
    Question number (integer), as a reference to the position in the questionnaire.
 
text
    Question text.
 
instruction
    Interviewer instruction.
 
answer_list
    Name of the list of answers (foreign key). The ``answers.csv``.
 
scale
    Scale (see list of scales below) of the answers.
 
filter
    Incoming filters (see definition below).
 
goto
    Outgoing filters (see definition below).
 
label
    Label (DEPRECATED).
 
description
    Human readable description including additional unstructured information.
 
concept
    Name of question's concept (foreign key). In DDI on Rails the primary link from a question to one or multiple concepts is through the question's logical variables. Nevertheless, it is possible to link a question or an item directly to a concept.
 

(3) Links to logical variables and concepts (import only): A
question can be linked to multiple logical variables. Therefore, DDI on
Rails stores this link with the logical variables. Yet, the questions
import allows to link every question to one logical variable.

logical_dataset
    Logical dataset name (foreign key).
 
logical_variable
    Logical variable name (foreign key).
 

(4) Export only: There is a couple of columns that is included in
the export but will not be imported.

view_sort_id
    Sort order of the questions. The ``view_sort_id`` is generated from the order of the questions in the import file.
 
view_lft
    and ``view_rgt`` Export only.
 
view_import_note
    Export only (DEPRECATED).
 
view_first_concept
    Concept of the question, based on the first related variable.
 
view_import_typ
    Export only (DEPRECATED).
 
view_calculated_number`` and ``view_calculated_item``
    Special information for imports following the SOEP-QLIB-conventions.
 
logical_variable
    Name of the resulting variable (foreign key, import only).
 
logical_dataset
    Name of the dataset of the resulting variable (foreign key, import only).
 

(5) Namespaces (neither imported nor exported): Every study can add
an arbitrary number of columns to store additional information that are
not intended to be imported in DDI on Rails. Those columns are prefixed
with ``internal_``

Scales
------

txt
    Only display the text, no variables are generated. All filters and instructions still apply.
 
chr
    Result is a character string.
 
int
    Result is a integer.
 
dec
    Result is a number with decimals.
 
bin
    Result is either true, false (equals "null")
 
cat
    Result is a pre-defined answer category. See ``answer_list`` for possible answers.
 

Rules for filter and goto
-------------------------

Filter and goto definitions consist of question names and symbols only,
no keywords (e.g. "goto") are used.

-  Symboles ``( ) = < > @ | & : != <= >=``
-  Filter ``(AGE > 20) & (SEX = 1)`` means: this question is asked if
   "age" is greater than 20 and "sex" is 1
-  Goto ``(2 @ TARGET)`` means: if the answer to the current question is
   2 then go to question "target"
-  Refer to items using the colon as a seperator, e.g. ``(PSOR:2 = 3)``.
-  Value lists and ranges: ``(x = 1:3)`` is equal to ``(x = 1,2,3)`` is
   equal to ``(x = 1) | (x = 2) | (x = 3)``
